# 5e-monster-scaler

Scales 5e monster stats up using the Dungeon Master's Guide's CR chart.

## Usage

`python3 monster_scaler.py`

1. Input a monster's current CR.
2. Input the CR you want to scale to.
3. Input the monster's AC, HP, and AB (core stats).
4. Input any damage or DC values to be scaled (can be done infinitely).
5. Back to step 1.

## Todo

- Add a flag for a 'long version' of inputting core stats (AC, HP, and AB) for people who don't like inputting them on one line (ie. enter each separately as opposed to comma-separated in one line)
